# Product Catalog

This app displays data from a API.
Since the URL provided doesn't accept CORS, I had to create a node/express server to expose an endpoint and add some headers to my server.
I used concurrently to be able to run multiple node tasks (start the express server and the react app) at the same time with a single command.
I used [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) for adding styles.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
